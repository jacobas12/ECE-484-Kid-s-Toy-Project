# ECE-484-Kid-s-Toy-Project
This page is a repository for the ECE 484 kid's toy individual project. This entire page and project were created by Allison Jacob.

The project in this repository is the code for a DIY RC car. This car uses a half-bridge driver and servo motors to drive around. It is controlled remotely using RF transceivers and a joystick attachment to control movement. 
Included within the main page is the code for the receiver, transceiver, and driving the robot. The wiki page contains a report of the project and images of the current status.
